Mod that adds an enemy based on the skaarj pupae of the game Unreal. It uses custom animations, AI and textures.

## Behaviour

* A small spider-like creature that roams around looking for players.
* After spotting a player it will chase it and leap when close enough.
* Not very dangerous when alone, but quite the nuisance when in groups.
* Nothing a good shovel cannot solve.

## Credits

* **DreWulff (me!)**: Animating and coding.
    * Source code: [LC-SkaarjPupae on github](https://github.com/DreWulff/LC-SkaarjPupae)

* Growth mechanic.

## Future projects

* More Unreal:
    * Passive creatures like [Nali cows](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Nali_Cow) and [rabbits](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Nali_Rabbit)
    * Hostile creatures like [Skaarj](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Skaarj_Warrior), [Slith](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Slith), [Tentacles](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Tentacle) and [Brutes](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Brute)
    * Moon (Maybe more than one. Who knows)
    * Scrap
* Original creatures, both hostile and passive.
* Maybe more stuff inspired/based on some of my favourite games, like:
    * Dungeon Siege
    * Grim Dawn
